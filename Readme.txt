Diggers

Development notes:

3/8/2008

This is a (multi-player?) game where players dig tunnels etc. through the earth, making
spaces and sculpting items. There are various substances that can be found
in the earth, useful and valuable for various purposes. Like metal ore may be shaped
into items. In addition to veins of substances, there could also be streams and pools
of water that can be tapped and dammed. There could also be hot areas, as in lava, as
well as areas of cold/ice. So for example, a lava flow could melt an ice pool.

There could also be rivalries between individuals and/or groups wherein you strive to
undermine their structures and possibly flood them.

There is an opportunity here for using a physics engine to manipulate items in the world.
This also could be a way to prototype sculpting tools.

The player might look like mole-like or ant-like creatures. They might need food and water
in order to survive, setting up natural cooperative/competition possibilities.

Started the game using JOGL. The initial game will be a 3D block world.

Possible features:

1. Digger and possible NPC diggers crawling along surfaces (no "flying"?)
2. Digger can "crack" blocks by repeatedly running into it. Should show progress
of breakage.
3. Digger can also push, pull, lift, and lower blocks within reach as long as
space allows.
4. Some blocks contain treasure such as gold and silver, which tends to run in
veins.  These veins might also be constant to allow improved digger performance.
5. Sounds: breaking and moving blocks, digger moving.
